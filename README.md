# Progress Tracker for Hill Climb Racing 2
This web-app is a way to track your stars in the mobile game hill climb racing 2. It has multiple features like a spreadsheet to easily see how many stars you have with each vehicle in each map. A miscellaneous tab which shows things like total stars, maps maxed (310,000 stars in 1 map), remaining 10ks left, and how many 10ks completed. There is also a seperate progress tab for each map which shows how many stars you have in that map, and also as a percentage.

This web-app was made using flask + jinja and sqlite studio for the database.
